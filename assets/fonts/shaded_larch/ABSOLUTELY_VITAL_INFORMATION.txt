Larch is a clear and crisp high quality script typeface. 
It consists of five weights: White, Bright, Shaded, Dark & Black.
Each style is working great separately, but they 
make the perfect combination together. 
Larch is designed by Måns Grebäck in 2016.

The font supports hundreds of languages. 
It contains contextual and stylistic alternates, swashes and ligatures. 

Write # after any lowercase letter to make swashes!

You can also write % after the following letters to make left swashes:
b d f h i j k l t

Example: Black% Lar#ch

(If it does not work, make sure your software supports ligatures, and 
that the ligature function is activated.)
